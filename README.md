# Reverse All The Scripts

Hello! In this repository you will find a collection of scripts that I am creating to test myself during my journey to become a Malware Analyst.

List of scripts and their features:

1. **PE static analysis** - automatic extraction of the juiciest information from a PE file
2. **x64dbg lummastealer unhoplowing** - x64dbg script that automates process un-hollowing until memory dump. Output here: https://federicofantini.github.io/TheTrackerShow/scripts/x64dbg/01-lummastealer_remote_code_injection/
3. **ida extract functions pseudocode** - this script capable of extracting the pseudocodes of all the functions present in the analyzed analysis
